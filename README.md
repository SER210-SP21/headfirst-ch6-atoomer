The way that the book uses 'ext.nav_version' in the buildbuildscript function in the project gradle file wasn't working (kept saying nav_version was unresolved). So I looked on the Kotlin website and used the way it says which was to add 'val nav_version = 2.7.7" above the plugin implementations in the dependencies function in the app gradle file.
